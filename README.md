# **Real-Time Language Detection System**
This project is a real-time language detection system built using FastAPI and Streamlit. It leverages machine learning models to accurately identify languages from user-inputted text, providing a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction.

Features
Real-Time Detection: Instantly detects the language of the text entered by the user.
Machine Learning-Powered: Utilizes pre-trained models for high accuracy.
User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for an intuitive and interactive frontend.
FastAPI Backend: Ensures a robust and scalable backend for handling requests.
Technologies Used
FastAPI: For creating a high-performance backend API.
Streamlit: For building the interactive web interface.
Machine Learning Models: Pre-trained models for language detection.
Python: Core language for development.
